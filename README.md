# Ph.D in Computer Science - Intelligent Systems
This repository tracks the coursework undertaken during my Ph.D program in Computer Science at the University of Texas, Dallas.

Within each of the courses, while my responses to assignments and code samples have been uploaded, I can only say that each of the responses are only true to my knowledge, and have been updated with instructor/TA responses only in some cases.

## Note to Prospective Plagiarizers:
I don't recommend using my code samples/responses for your assignments. I am a firm believer in Academic Honesty and if reached out to, I will definitely side with your TA and Instructor. So please, DON'T!
